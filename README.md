This is my fork of Greg Brown's repo for the Ruby Best Practices book.  I
have updated these examples to work with Ruby 1.9.3 and a current Ruby environment,
specifically adding a Gemfile to manage dependencies through Ruby.  I am
doing this for a book review that I am leading at my company.  You can see
my presentation on the first chapter [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12P_uHSkHBoB1WCgyh2m8iiiwZQFP0tdcM2lX5uYxMoo/edit).

== "Ruby Best Practices" Code Samples ==

This repository is for the code samples from the O'Reilly book "Ruby Best
Practices" by Gregory Brown, available at:

  http://rubybestpractices.com

All of the examples here are free software, but some license terms and proper
attributions might be missing from code segments until the time of publication
of the book.  This means if you wish to re-use any code seen here, please
contact me at gregory.t.brown@gmail.com and I'll let you know who wrote it and
what the terms are.  I will be sure to update these things before the book hits
the shelf.

Although the code samples might be an interesting teaser, they might not be
useful out of context, as some of the examples seen here are actually
anti-patterns to best practices.

Eventually, all of the non-trivial code samples that appear in the book will be in
this repository. For now, it will be incomplete and in constant flux.

Enjoy, and please contact me with any questions.
